This project utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on given environmental factors. The dataset includes values such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. By training the model on these features, it accurately predicts the ideal crop to cultivate.
